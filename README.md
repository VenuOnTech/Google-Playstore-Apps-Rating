# üìä Google Play Store Apps: A Comprehensive Analysis

This project performs an **in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on the **Google Play Store dataset**.  
The goal is to uncover insights into app categories, user ratings, sentiment, and the key factors that correlate with app success.

The final analysis is presented as an **interactive Streamlit web application**.

## üóÇÔ∏è 1. About the Datasets

This analysis utilizes **two separate datasets**, both located in the `datasets/` folder:

### **üìÅ datasets/googleplaystore.csv**
This dataset contains the core information for over **10,000 apps** on the Google Play Store.  
Each row represents a unique app and includes attributes such as:

- **App:** The name of the application  
- **Category:** The category the app belongs to (e.g., `GAME`, `FAMILY`, `MEDICAL`)  
- **Rating:** The average user rating for the app (out of 5)  
- **Reviews:** The total number of user reviews  
- **Size:** The size of the app (in MBs or KBs)  
- **Installs:** The approximate number of times the app has been installed  
- **Type:** Whether the app is `Free` or `Paid`  
- **Price:** The price of the app (if Paid)  
- **Content Rating:** The maturity rating (e.g., `Everyone`, `Teen`, `Mature 17+`)  
- **Genres:** The genre(s) of the app  
- **Last Updated:** The date the app was last updated  

### **üìÅ datasets/googleplaystore_user_reviews.csv**
This dataset contains approximately **64,000 user reviews** for various apps.  
The key columns are:

- **App:** The name of the app the review is for  
- **Translated_Review:** The text of the user review (translated to English)  
- **Sentiment:** A categorical sentiment (`Positive`, `Negative`, `Neutral`)  
- **Sentiment_Polarity:** A numerical score from **-1** (very negative) to **+1** (very positive)

We **merge these two datasets** to link quantitative app metrics with qualitative user sentiment.

## üéØ 2. Project Objectives

Our analysis was guided by **7 key objectives**:

1. **Analyze App Distribution and Quality:**  
   Investigate which app categories dominate the Play Store and which categories have the highest average user ratings.

2. **Investigate Key Metric Correlations:**  
   Use log-transforms to visualize the relationships between `Rating`, `Reviews`, `Installs`, and `Size`.

3. **Compare Free vs. Paid App Performance:**  
   Determine if paid apps receive significantly different ratings than free apps, and validate this using a **Mann-Whitney U test**.

4. **Correlate User Sentiment with Ratings:**  
   Verify if the sentiment expressed in written reviews (`Sentiment_Polarity`) aligns with the app's overall star rating.

5. **Assess the Impact of Content Rating:**  
   Analyze the distribution of apps by content rating and see how this impacts their average star rating.

6. **Analyze "App Freshness" (Feature Engineering):**  
   Engineer a new feature, `Days_Since_Update`, to test the hypothesis that apps updated more frequently have higher ratings.

7. **Perform Basic NLP on Reviews (Word Clouds):**  
   Generate word clouds for the most-reviewed apps to visually identify the most common themes and keywords in user feedback.

## üîç 3. Key Findings

Our analysis uncovered several **key findings**:

- **Category:**  
  `FAMILY` and `GAME` are the largest app categories. However, `EVENTS`, `EDUCATION`, and `ART_AND_DESIGN` have the highest average user ratings ‚Äî showing that **niche categories** often have more satisfied users.

- **Correlations:**  
  After a log-transform, we found a **strong positive correlation** between `Reviews` and `Installs`.  
  Also, a clear positive correlation exists between an app's `Rating` and its number of `Reviews`, indicating that **higher-rated apps tend to be more popular** (or vice versa).

- **Free vs. Paid:**  
  Paid apps have a **statistically significant (p < 0.05)** higher median rating than free apps.  
  While the difference is small, it‚Äôs **not due to random chance**.

- **Sentiment:**  
  There is a **strong, positive correlation** between an app's average `Sentiment_Polarity` and its `Rating`.  
  This confirms that user star ratings and written feedback are **highly aligned**.

- **Content Rating:**  
  The vast majority of apps are rated **Everyone**.  
  Interestingly, **Adults only 18+** apps had a slightly higher median rating, while **Mature 17+** had the widest range of ratings.

- **App Freshness:**  
  We found a **slight negative correlation** between `Rating` and `Days_Since_Update`.  
  This supports our hypothesis: apps that are updated more frequently (fewer days since their last update) tend to have **slightly higher ratings**.

- **NLP Findings (Word Clouds):**  
  Word clouds for popular apps like **WhatsApp** and **Facebook** revealed common keywords like *‚Äúeasy to use‚Äù*, *‚Äúgood‚Äù*, *‚Äúproblems‚Äù*, *‚Äúads‚Äù*, and *‚Äúplease fix‚Äù* ‚Äî providing a direct line of sight into **user pain points**.

## üß† 4. Understandings & Conclusion

This project demonstrates a **complete data analysis pipeline**, from **data cleaning** and **feature engineering** to **advanced visualization** and **statistical testing**.

### **Key Takeaways:**
- A successful app is a **balance of many factors** ‚Äî not just being free.  
- Success correlates with:
  - **User engagement** (high Reviews)
  - **Developer maintenance** (frequent updates)
  - **User satisfaction** (high Rating and positive Sentiment)

### **Data Quality Matters:**
The analysis also highlights the **critical importance of data cleaning**.  
Initial visualizations were misleading due to:
- Skewed data (`Reviews`, `Installs`)
- Missing values (`Rating`)

By addressing these through:
- **Log-transforms**
- **Median imputation**
- **Visualizing missing data first**

we were able to uncover **more accurate and reliable insights**.
